For challenge 1 I used a while loop because the number of steps wthat were needed
until the number came 1 was unknown. I did not use ai for this secion

For challenge 2 I used a for loop because I needed to check every number from 2 up to n-1 to see if the number was prime. 
I used AI to help me understand how to stop the loop when I found a divisor and how to print the divisor that makes the number not prime.  

For challenge 3 I used nested for loops because I needed one loop for the rows and one for the columns to make a grid. 
I used AI to help me figure out how to format the multiplication table so that the numbers lined up in columns.
